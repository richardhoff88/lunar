Overview
This script is designed to analyze real-time telemetry data from a spacecraft, specifically targeting solar panel voltages, battery status, system current, temperatures, and sun sensor data. It extracts relevant columns from the dataset and generates multiple plots to visualize how various subsystems of the spacecraft behave over time.

Data
The telemetry data is expected to be provided in a CSV file named sat_realtime_telemetry.csv. This file contains time-stamped telemetry readings, including:

Solar panel voltages (X, Y, Z axes)
Battery voltage
Total system current
Boost converter temperatures
Sun sensor data (X+, Y+, Z+)
CSV File Columns:
Satellite Date/Time UTC: Time in UTC for each telemetry reading.
Solar Panel Voltage X/Y/Z mV: Millivolts generated by the solar panels along the X, Y, and Z axes.
Battery Voltage mV: Millivolts measured in the spacecraft's battery.
Total System Current mA: The spacecraft's total current consumption in milliamps.
Boost Converter Temp 1/2 C: The temperatures of the spacecraft's boost converters in Celsius.
Sun Sensor X+/Y+/Z+: Values from the sun sensor, indicating the spacecraft's orientation relative to the Sun.
Script Functionality
The script extracts data from the CSV file and generates several plots to help analyze the spacecraft's power consumption, solar energy generation, and thermal management:

Total Solar Panel Voltage over Time: A plot showing the solar panel voltage for the X, Y, and Z axes over time. This plot visualizes how power generation changes as the spacecraft orbits and adjusts its orientation relative to the Sun.

Battery Voltage over Time: This plot shows the battery voltage fluctuations, helping to understand the spacecraft’s charging and discharging cycles.

Total System Current over Time: This plot tracks the spacecraft's total power consumption.

Boost Converter Temperature over Time: Displays the temperatures of two boost converters to monitor thermal conditions.

Sun Sensor Data over Time: A plot that displays the sun sensor data for the X, Y, and Z axes, indicating the spacecraft's orientation relative to the Sun over time.

How to Run the Script
Make sure you have Python installed with the required libraries: matplotlib and csv. You can install matplotlib using:

Copy code
pip install matplotlib
Place the sat_realtime_telemetry.csv file in the same directory as the script.

Run the script:

Copy code
python lunar_trailblazer_telemetry.py
The script will generate multiple plots, each one showing different aspects of the spacecraft’s performance.

Potential Enhancements
Add error handling for missing or corrupt data.
Improve the time axis formatting for better readability of the plots.
Implement real-time data analysis for live telemetry feeds.
Include additional spacecraft subsystems for further analysis (e.g., RF signals, propulsion data).
